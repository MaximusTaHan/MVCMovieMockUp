# MVCMovieMockUp
Asp.net MVC for Movies to a SQL database. Scaffolded with EF and pages with Razor.

This project was built to learn and understand the flow of an asp.net MVC web app.

The relation between web page requests to the controller and how the controller requests data from the database through the model
to display the proper information on the page.

The app itself can:
  Makes movies with properties
    ID
    Title
    ReleaseDate
    Genre
    Rating
  Displays these movies with CRUD operations available for each.
  Search functions are available through text and a drop down genre filter.
  Validation for the Create action window.
  
I learnt a ton from this project.
  How the programs entry point works.
  Initialize data if there is none.
  How the URL mapping works.
  How to connect to/and how to work with a database (SQL database in this case).
  Work with Entity Framework to setup the database/controller Code first.
